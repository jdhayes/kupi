# JellyFin

There are few repos in DockerHub, one mentions arm64 support [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/jellyfin).

The "official" DockerHub image does not mention arm64 support, but does have a GitHub repo that contains a Dockerfile in order to build one, [here](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/blob/master/Dockerfile.arm64).

## Ansible

Some guy's Ansible setup for Jellyfin (and other stuff) [here](https://github.com/Kimi450/ubuntu_server).
